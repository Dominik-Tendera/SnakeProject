# Snake game
### 2022 Student project
The project utilized 5x7 segment LEDs, an ATmega328PB microcontroller, and a matrix of buttons.

The game is controlled using five buttons, four of which are designated for steering the snake. When the snake's head consumes food, its length increases, and a new food item appears randomly on the display. 
The snake is able to pass through the walls, reappearing on the opposite side of the display.
